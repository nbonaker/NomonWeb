Otherwise once you learn the count times between the letters it makes it easier to not have as many mistakes\u0027,\n       \u0027Nothing new to add from my previous observations, but this keyboard feels like more of a chore than Keyboard A.\u0027,\n       \u0027It feels really slow to type with this keyboard and this slowness can amount to frustration. It8s definitely easier on the physical and mental stress since there8s more time in between each head tilts.\u0027,\n       \u0027did not likethat the second line comes and goes so fast I always missed selecting it.

This makes it much easier (less cognitive load), but I think that it can be a little slow. As I use this interface more and more, I feel like I need to keep increasing the speed. \u0027,\n       \u0027I find it frustrating how long it takes wait for a row to scan through twice if accidentally hit. Even with the scan speed up it8s annoying. \u0027,\n       \u0027I like that you can change the speed after each sentence, it is not as tedious as the clock keyboard\u0027,\n       \u0027Very success oriented but slower to get to full words.\u0027,\n       \u0027I liked that you could adjust the speeds of the scanning. \u0027,\n       \u0027If you need one of the less common options it takes awhile to reach it (more waiting than the clocks)\u0027,\n       \u0027This session went much better.

However, as I had more time to practice both interfaces, I became a lot more comfortable with both of them. I still think I slightly prefer Keyboard B because it is easier for me (a little less cognitive load), but that is only true when I am able to adjust the cursor speed upward and there are not a lot of out-of-vocabulary words in the phrases.
